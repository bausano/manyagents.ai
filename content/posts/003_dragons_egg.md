I present you a script for a short animation about Robert L. Forward's hard
sci-fi book [_Dragon's Egg_][wiki-dragons-egg]: 

Some 50 million years ago a supergiant star collapsed. Its unimaginably bright
death roar, a supernovae, gave birth to an extraordinary object - a neutron
star. An anomaly set this neutron star on a course towards the Solar system
where human astrophysicists would name it "Dragon's Egg".

Our brains are not capable to deal with the extremities on this strange, 20km
wide object. The gravitational pull is so strong that a poppy seed would weight
over 20 tonnes. A cubic centimeter of Dragon's Egg's magnetic field contains
yearly energy output of a nuclear plant[^1]. The whole star spins 5 times a
second and has a few centimeters thick iron vapor atmosphere. Underneath the
atmosphere is a thin layer of nuclei matter. The complex interactions in the
matter are analogical to our chemistry and ultimately result in
self-replicating sequences, opening the door for life.

This is the home of cheela, a tribal species evolved from a plant-like
ancestor. Because the interactions between the nuclei tick a million times
faster than the interactions between atoms, cheela live and die on much shorter
time scales. Their day lasts a fifth of a second and an individual cheela lives
about 40 minutes.

Soon after cheela mastered agriculture, a massive volcano disrupts their farms.
Most cheela try to escape by traveling along the magnetic lines. But one clan
sends the fittest scouts across magnetic lines in the so called "hard
direction". Over the equator, they discover a garden of eden - rich land free
of the poisonous volcano debris. However, travel in the hard direction poses a
challenge for the young and the old cheela. In a leap of abstract thinking a
genius cheela "Great Crack" invents arithmetics. Great Crack calculates how
much rations does the clan need for the journey and successfully leads the clan
to the promise land.

[The clan is under attack, they form tight pack to travel, the exort much
effort to travel across magnetic field lines.]

A human expedition establishes a base near the star. Scientists launch several
objects into the orbit around Dragon's Egg, one of them being a small manned
observatory. Meanwhile, cheela built a prosperous empire in the new land.

- religion, building of monument
- barbarism and contact with human, 2+2=4, the slow ones aren't gods, human
  sending library

In the end, Dragon's Egg is a testament to the human captivation by
extraterrestrial intelligence. And although recent research suggests that the
specific conditions which gave rise to the cheela civilization are unlikely to
be present on the crust of a neutron star[^2], the message of the book rings
strong nonetheless:

- reminant 
- If we communicate with aliens on long distances, we're slow ones to each other.
